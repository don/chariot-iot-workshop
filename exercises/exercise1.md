# Exercise 1 - Development Environment

Set up your computer for Arduino development.

## Arduino IDE
Install the Arduino IDE from https://arduino.cc/downloads

### Arduino Libraries        
Install the following Arduino Libraries using the Library manager. 

* WiFi101 library (search for "WiFi101 WINC")
* WiFiNINA library (search for "NINA")
* Arduino MQTT Client library (search for "ArduinoMQTTClient")
* Arduino BearSSL library (search for "ECCX")
* Arduino ECCX08  library (search for "ECCX")
* DHT sensor library by Adafruit (search for "DHT")
* Adafruit Unified Sensor library (search for "adafruit abstraction")

Open the library manager using the menu _Sketch -> Include Libraries -> Manage Libraries_

### Linux

Linux users probably need to add their user to the dialout group in order to access the serial port.

    sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>
    
See the [Linux Installation Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/linux) for more details.
